    <h2>
            Grid based design
        </h2>
        <p>
            Grids are key to organisation on the webpage. They allow designers to easily create patterns and symmetry in a way
            that is pleasing to the user and simple to represent on a webpage.<br>
            Grids also provide a conceptual way to scale up and down page view. Responsive webpage layouts are booming as the habits of
            consumers move more towards consuming digital media on mobile devices, rather than traditional computers. Needing to represent
            webpages in both these fashions means needing to adopt a shared design language and practice. Grids, with their ability to scale 
            up and down at will, are a good fit for this.

        <h2>
            Semantic structure
        </h2>
        <p>
            Semantic tags in HTML are the tags that give the reader and the browser deeper knowledge about the actual purpose of the content being 
            displayed and the structure is how this is all organised in terms of parent/child relationships. Semantic tags have come about so that 
            browers are able to represent information in a more meaningful way. When using generic tags like div, there is no context around what 
            the content may be or relate to. To add context a semantic tag can be used; for example h1 indicates that what is written is a header 
            for the whole page, or time denotes a date/time. This information is of particular value to search engines that want to represent 
            meaningful information to their users.
