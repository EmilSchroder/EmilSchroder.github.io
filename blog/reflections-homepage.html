                            <h2>Search Inside Yourself - Chapter 7 - Connecting</h2>
                            <p>
                                The empathetic listening is a bit odd because the people I talk with expect more input (more interesting input explicitly)
                                than what the empathetic listening prescribes; it unnerves people a bit. I have begun approaching interpersonal 
                                situations with more openness and positivity and it seems to make people more well disposed.<br>
                                For the political awareness exercise there was a time at work where someone wasn't following a process and it 
                                was causing a headache for everyone but them. I explained to them that these processes were in place to 
                                promote transparency and ultimately make it easier for everyone involved as long as people took the time to understand 
                                it. From his perspective he will have seen it as red tape that was stopping the outcome that he wanted. 
                            </p>
                            <h2>Search Inside Yourself - Chapter 6 - Motivation</h2>
                            <p>
                                Reflecting on what I go after most I realise I have been more pleasure focussed, not finding
                                much passion or purpose in my work and just using my spare time to recharge. Recently I've been
                                able to concentrate on coding and creating which definately has enagaged my passion side.<br>
                                My core values centre around enjoying life and having fun in whatever I do, and I feel like I 
                                have failed when I am not enjoying my surroundings. I liked the exercise around allowing yourself 
                                to feel both success and defeat and breaking them down into their physiological components. It 
                                let me recognise that dread and elation have similar symptoms, but dread has more closed off body 
                                language like hunched shoulders.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Search Inside Yourself - Chapter 5 - Triggers</h2>
                            <p>
                                The biggest trigger I get when I am programming is where I am sure what I have written is correct, but it gets
                                throwing error messages. I get irrationally angry and start to think it is the computer who is wrong (which makes
                                absolutely no sense). The Siberian North Railroad has been useful in reflecting on some of the times I've got triggered.
                                When reflecting it is very easy to dredge those feelings of frustration up, which isn't great in general but really useful 
                                for this exercise.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Search Inside Yourself - Chapter 4 - Body Scanning</h2>
                            <p>
                                Self awareness seems to be a subset of mindfulness. Mindfulness maintains attention on an action or view
                                without the mind imposing itself on that action or view. Self awareness is the special case of the view
                                being that of your own body.<br>
                                I tried the body scanning and agreed with the author that it was very closely related to feeling sleepy. 
                                I have not been in a particularly emotionally turbulent state recently so its effects didn't feel very pronounced.<br>
                                In the "Emotions are not me" section the author notes you can consider your emotional state as seperate from
                                your being and that the link between the two can be regulated. Controlling your emotions is certainly a 
                                large part of a reasoned emotional response to a stressful situation. His points around the dichotomy of
                                the ego were also interesting.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Mindfulness Conversation</h2>
                            <p>
                                The conversation seemed fairly ordinary.
                                I grew up with a lot of audio books (and now podcasts)
                                so paying attention while listening has been 
                                something that is natural. The other person thought
                                it was weird; that is expected when you ask someone
                                to speak on the spot for 3 minutes.<br>
                                Listening is the easiest for practicing so I will
                                go with that to sustain my practice. People at
                                work like to talk so there will be ample opportunity.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Search Inside Yourself - chapter 2</h2>
                            <p>
                                My previous impressions of meditation were that it acted to calm the mind down by just sitting there and thinking
                                of one particular thing. The reality seems quite different. You should start with a reason, or intention, 
                                as to why you are doing it to set the tone for purposeful action. Treating attention wandering as an ability
                                to flex your attention redirection rather than a failure of practice was also a new aspect of meditation 
                                that I hadn't considered before. I am currently using the process model for mindful meditation; I have not been
                                doing it for long so can't really say how I am finding it yet.
                            </p>


                            <h2>Meditation Process</h2>
                            <p>
                                The process over product style of learning is definately making sure I don't spiral into despair.
                                It is still tempting to try a little bit too hard to perfect your current product, however I've been
                                keeping in mind the idea of a <a href="https://www.shmoop.com/second-derivatives/local-global-points.html">
                                local maximum versus a global maximum</a>. If you optimise a suboptimal solution too far then you are not
                                taking into account the big picture where a big event, like a site redesign, will be necessary in the future.
                                I'm trying to create a mindset around being excited by other EDA member's good websites (instead of jelous) 
                                so that I keep pushing through the work with the idea that time and absorption will get me to the same level.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
                            <p>
                                The first chapter of "Search Inside Yourself" brought up some interesting ideas that 
                                I've also seen voiced by psychology writers like gamification proponent Jane McGonigal around
                                the idea of neuroplasticity and our ability to manually reshape our own perceptions. It is a bit 
                                terrifying the ways in which the brain can be exploited and re-programmed, even if the intention is 
                                to create a happier life for yourself. The most interesting fact the first chapter revealed was the 
                                wisdom centre of our brains, the basal ganglia, has no connection with the verbal processing area, which 
                                helps explain why sensations and emotions are often very difficult to articulate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My mindfulness exercise was very relaxing. I am lucky to have a window with a view of some trees 
                                so some non-judgmental watching of branches sway proved restful. I will not make the mistake of setting an alarm 
                                next time because it is a shock to the system when that goes off after striving to achieve calmness.
                            </p>
                            <h2>First Reflection</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Mindset is the biggest upfront message that EDA has focussed on. It is 
                                    an approach that is tightly aligned to the theories around gameplay style 
                                    learning where exploration and failure are built in as features to the 
                                    experience, something that can't be avoided so shouldn't be avoided.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ultimately you don't always know if you are going to gel with a particular
                                    culture or not until you're in it. I like working with people; they brighten
                                    up the day and feedback on ideas. This kind of problem solving work is
                                    also a huge amount of fun which helps with powering through the small things like existential
                                    dread or stuffing up for the hundreth time. My biggest concern is getting
                                    into the work in a group situation and not having anything interesting to share
                                    or contribute. This never really turns out to be true for anyone as everyone has some
                                    unique perspective however rationality and fear are not always entangled so the feeling
                                    is hard to dismiss.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Sum-up: this whole adventure will be quite exciting and I look forward to seeing
                                    my fingers and a keyboard are capable of producing. Ideally something useful.
