                                The first chapter of "Search Inside Yourself" brought up some interesting ideas that 
                                I've also seen voiced by psychology writers like gamification proponent Jane McGonigal around
                                the idea of neuroplasticity and our ability to manually reshape our own perceptions. It is a bit 
                                terrifying the ways in which the brain can be exploited and re-programmed, even if the intention is 
                                to create a happier life for yourself. The most interesting fact the first chapter revealed was the 
                                wisdom centre of our brains, the basal ganglia, has no connection with the verbal processing area, which 
                                helps explain why sensations and emotions are often very difficult to articulate.

                                My mindfulness exercise was very relaxing. I am lucky to have a window with a view of some trees 
                                so some non-judgmental watching of branches sway proved restful. I will not make the mistake of setting an alarm 
                                next time because it is a shock to the system when that goes off after striving to achieve calmness.

                                    Mindset is the biggest upfront message that EDA has focussed on. It is 
                                    an approach that is tightly aligned to the theories around gameplay style 
                                    learning where exploration and failure are built in as features to the 
                                    experience, something that can't be avoided so shouldn't be avoided.
                                </p>

                                    Ultimately you don't always know if you are going to gel with a particular
                                    culture or not until you're in it. I like working with people; they brighten
                                    up the day and feedback on ideas. This kind of problem solving work is
                                    also a huge amount of fun which helps with powering through the small things like existential
                                    dread or stuffing up for the hundreth time. My biggest concern is getting
                                    into the work in a group situation and not having anything interesting to share
                                    or contribute. This never really turns out to be true for anyone as everyone has some
                                    unique perspective however rationality and fear are not always entangled so the feeling
                                    is hard to dismiss.

                                    Sum-up: this whole adventure will be quite exciting and I look forward to seeing
                                    my fingers and a keyboard are capable of producing. Ideally something useful.
