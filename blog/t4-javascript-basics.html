        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p>
            Javascript is a language that can create and alter objects
            and variables. It differs from HTML in that if doesn't outline 
            a structure for webpage or work in a tag based way. It is also
            different from CSS as it can be used to alter existing objects
            rather than just style them.<br>
            Loops work in an intuative way where you set initial conditions, 
            constraints and an iteration pattern, and then allow it perform its
            action on the object or variable that is within the loop. For example
            you can use the idea of spreading butter on toast. You start with no 
            butter on your and you keep spreading more on until the toast is covered
            in butter.

            Arrays and objects are both ways of storing data in Javascript. Arrays have
            elements are are stored in an ordered set where the zeroth (initial or first) element
            is at the front of the set with the n-1th at the end. To access an element you
            can call its position in the line up.<br>
            Object have properties that are denoted by a name, but don't have a purposeful order.
            There are a couple of ways to call properties from objects; the first is the dot notation
            for a string or conversion of a string i.e. myCouch.redCushion. The second is bracket
            notation and can be used when the property is not a string like in this example 
            where there is a space between the words i.e. myCouch["Red Cushion"].<br>
            Functions are sets of code where you plug in variables and they return an answer or 
            set of answers (depending of specifications) based off those variables (typically).
            They are useful as black boxes where you can throw variables at them and get meaningful
            answers in return.
