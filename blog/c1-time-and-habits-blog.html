      First Thoughts
  </h2> 
      <p>
          Being at the start of this journey I haven't had the opportunity to go through too many of the techniques that were advised. I am
          glad that the course summarises some of the methods out there because, while independent investigation is important, there are not
          enough minutes in a lifetime to trawl through every internet article that claims to have the secret. I am going to focus on the strategies
          that seem a bit more thought out, so while I have a deep love for advice listicles I will perhaps steer clear for the time being.
      </p>
      <p>
          Three of the tips I am going to try in the next week are:
        <ul>
          <li>Meditation - thousands of monks can't be wrong</li>
          <li>Pomodoro Technique - it comes highly recommended and makes conceptual sense</li>
          <li>Analysing my rythmn - like a cicada I need to find out what gels and what grates</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          I'll keep this updated in the coming weeks.
