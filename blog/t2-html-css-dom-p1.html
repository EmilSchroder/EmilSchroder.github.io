    <h2>
        HTML, CSS and DOM
    </h2> 
    <p>
        In short in a webpage HTML sets the structure, makes it pretty, and the DOM acts as an interface with HTML 
        so that other programmes can act upon it.<br>
        This set of friends can be thought of like an external hardrive. The HTML is the circuit board, CSS is the
        box that houses it, and the DOM is the USB dongle that lets it connect into things like the TV or computer.

    <h2>
        Boxifying Design
    </h2>
    <p>
        Boxifying is what it sounds like, turning an open space (in this case the webpage) into a set of rectangles 
        with their own unqiue place and, ideally, purpose. Breaking it down into these boxes allows easier design of the page
        as the boxes are self container and only the size, margins and padding of a box impacts other boxes, not what is in it.
