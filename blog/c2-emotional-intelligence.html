            The first chapter of "Search Inside Yourself" brought up some interesting ideas that 
            I've also seen voiced by psychology writers like gamification proponent Jane McGonigal around
            the idea of neuroplasticity and our ability to manually reshape our own perceptions. It is a bit 
            terrifying the ways in which the brain can be exploited and re-programmed, even if the intention is 
            to create a happier life for yourself. The most interesting fact the first chapter revealed was the 
            wisdom centre of our brains, the basal ganglia, has no connection with the verbal processing area, which 
            helps explain why sensations and emotions are often very difficult to articulate.

            My mindfulness exercise was very relaxing. I am lucky to have a window with a view of some trees 
            so some non-judgmental watching of branches sway proved restful. I will not make the mistake of setting an alarm 
            next time because it is a shock to the system when that goes off after striving to achieve calmness.
