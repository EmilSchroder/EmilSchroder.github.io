                                        <h2>Scope in Javascript</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            Scope translates to visibility for variables in code. There are two scopes in Javascript; global and 
                                            local. Global variables are variables declared outside of a function and can be seen and 
                                            accessed from anywhere inside your code.<br>
                                            Functions have their own scope, so any variable defined within this scope (i.e. defined within the function) is 
                                            localised to that function, hence the name local variable. If that function also calls any 
                                            subfunctions then the variable is visible from them as well. It pays to note that a variable declared inside a subfunction 
                                            will not visible to the superfunction as its own more localised scope.

                                            <h3>Bracket Notation</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                
                                                <h4>Round Brackets <code>()</code></h4>
                                                There are a few serperate areas where round brakcets crop up.
                                                They can be used for loops to hold true/false statements i.e. 
                                                <code>if(n<5)</code>. In other loops they can have initial conditions and 
                                                iteration steps as well i.e. <code>for (var n=0, n<5, n++)</code>.
                                                In functions they contain the input parameters that the function requires to run like 
                                                <code>function carrots (water, soil, seeds){};</code>. Finally the can be used in the pure 
                                                mathematical way to show which operation is prioritised; the following would sum <code>b</code> and
                                                <code>c</code> together before subtracting the total from <code>a</code>:<br>
                                                <code>x = a - (b + c);</code>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <h4>Square Brackets<code>[]</code></h4>
                                                Square brackets are often seen setting up arrays and accessing elements in those arrays like numbers or objects. Arrays are 
                                                a structured data format so every element has a fixed position where the first element is denoted as 
                                                <code>Array[0]</code> and the sequential elements are counted up from there so that <code>nth element = Array[n-1]</code>.<br>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <h4>Curly Brackets<code>{}</code></h4>
                                                Curly brackets are used to contain processes that need to be run or to set up objects. For containg 
                                                processes take a <code>for</code> loop. Everything that needs to be run according to the loops instructions happens within
                                                the defined curly brackets.<br>
                                                For example <code>for (var i=0, i<10, i++){count++}</code> increases the <code>count</code> by one while the loop conditions remain true.<br>
                                                For setting up objects a new variable is declared with the properties of the object (once the curly brackets get involved the variable becomes
                                                an object) listed within the curly brackets. This <code>tree</code> is an example object:<br>
                                                <code>var tree = {branches: 100, leaves: 1000, trunk: 1};</code>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <h4>Single and Double Quote Marks - <code>''</code> & <code>""</code></h4>
                                                Everything inside quote marks is considered a string. They can be used interchangably.

                                            <h2>Getting Blocked</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                In sprint 4 I was horribly blocked by one of the practice JS questions. There was
                                                something about it where I couldn't work out how the syntax was supposed to be ordered. I started
                                                with trial and error but then moved on to psuedocode but no luck.<br>
                                                There was fortunatley a lot of resources online and I was able to find a similar question that 
                                                incorporated the same syntax which I was able to mimic and make fit.<br>
                                                Solving it was a huge relief, though I am glad for the struggle because it is the dread of going
                                                through that drawn-out thought process again that really cements the knowledge in your mind.
                                                I didn't learn that much in a meta sense (of course I learnt the necessary syntax to resolve the issue)
                                                but it is good to reaffirm that sticking to it will get you the results you want.
                                            </p>

                                            <h2>Javascript</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Javascript is a language that can create and alter objects
                                                and variables. It differs from HTML in that if doesn't outline 
                                                a structure for webpage or work in a tag based way. It is also
                                                different from CSS as it can be used to alter existing objects
                                                rather than just style them.<br>
                                                Loops work in an intuative way where you set initial conditions, 
                                                constraints and an iteration pattern, and then allow it perform its
                                                action on the object or variable that is within the loop. For example
                                                you can use the idea of spreading butter on toast. You start with no 
                                                butter on your and you keep spreading more on until the toast is covered
                                                in butter.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Arrays and objects are both ways of storing data in Javascript. Arrays have
                                                elements are are stored in an ordered set where the zeroth (initial or first) element
                                                is at the front of the set with the n-1th at the end. To access an element you
                                                can call its position in the line up.<br>
                                                Object have properties that are denoted by a name, but don't have a purposeful order.
                                                There are a couple of ways to call properties from objects; the first is the dot notation
                                                for a string or conversion of a string i.e. myCouch.redCushion. The second is bracket
                                                notation and can be used when the property is not a string like in this example 
                                                where there is a space between the words <br>i.e. myCouch["Red Cushion"].<br>
                                                Functions are sets of code where you plug in variables and they return an answer or 
                                                set of answers (depending of specifications) based off those variables (typically).
                                                They are useful as black boxes where you can throw variables at them and get meaningful
                                                answers in return.

                                                Frameworks give a pre-configured base and rules set to allow you to start building websites quickly and simply. The developer benefits from
                                                not having to spend time building the same functionality from scratch. The downsides are a standarised model which can leave the design
                                                feeling a bit bland.

                                                Website designers must have an idea about how people are viewing their content which means the behavior and habits of the consumers
                                                must be acknowledged when a website is being created. If your target audience is split between browsing on their phones, tablets and computers
                                                then you need a way of making sure all three are accomodated. Responsive websites are designed to allow the aesthetics and functionality of a website
                                                to remain intact no matter the size of the viewing screen.<br>

                                                and with the lesser processing power of a phone compared to a computer their is a rise in "mobile-first" design. This assumes the mobile device
                                                is the default viewer and has the developer put its design considerations first.

                                                to put certain boxes that will hold content. I found that many of the features I had drawn up in the wireframes surpassed my technical knowledge
                                                so comprimised quite heavily to produce what I have.

                                                    In short in a webpage HTML sets the structure, makes it pretty, and the DOM acts as an interface with HTML 
                                                    so that other programmes can act upon it.<br>
                                                    This set of friends can be thought of like an external hardrive. The HTML is the circuit board, CSS is the
                                                    box that houses it, and the DOM is the USB dongle that lets it connect into things like the TV or computer.

                                                    Boxifying is what it sounds like, turning an open space (in this case the webpage) into a set of rectangles 
                                                    with their own unqiue place and, ideally, purpose. Breaking it down into these boxes allows easier design of the page
                                                    as the boxes are self container and only the size, margins and padding of a box impacts other boxes, not what is in it.

                                                    Grid based design

                                                    Grids are key to organisation on the webpage. They allow designers to easily create patterns and symmetry in a way
                                                    that is pleasing to the user and simple to represent on a webpage.<br>
                                                    Grids also provide a conceptual way to scale up and down page view. Responsive webpage layouts are booming as the habits of
                                                    consumers move more towards consuming digital media on mobile devices, rather than traditional computers. Needing to represent
                                                    webpages in both these fashions means needing to adopt a shared design language and practice. Grids, with their ability to scale 
                                                    up and down at will, are a good fit for this.

                                                    Semantic tags in HTML are the tags that give the reader and the browser deeper knowledge about the actual purpose of the content being 
                                                    displayed and the structure is how this is all organised in terms of parent/child relationships. Semantic tags have come about so that 
                                                    browers are able to represent information in a more meaningful way. When using generic tags like div, there is no context around what 
                                                    the content may be or relate to. To add context a semantic tag can be used; for example h1 indicates that what is written is a header 
                                                    for the whole page, or time denotes a date/time. This information is of particular value to search engines that want to represent 
                                                    meaningful information to their users.
