                            <h2>Scope in Javascript</h2>
                            <p>
                                Scope translates to visibility for variables in code. There are two scopes in Javascript; global and 
                                local. Global variables are variables declared outside of a function and can be seen and 
                                accessed from anywhere inside your code.<br>
                                Functions have their own scope, so any variable defined within this scope (i.e. defined within the function) is 
                                localised to that function, hence the name local variable. If that function also calls any 
                                subfunctions then the variable is visible from them as well. It pays to note that a variable declared inside a subfunction 
                                will not visible to the superfunction as its own more localised scope.
