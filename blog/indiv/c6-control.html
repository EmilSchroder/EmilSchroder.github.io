                            <p>
                                The biggest trigger I get when I am programming is where I am sure what I have written is correct, but it gets
                                throwing error messages. I get irrationally angry and start to think it is the computer who is wrong (which makes
                                absolutely no sense). The Siberian North Railroad has been useful in reflecting on some of the times I've got triggered.
                                When reflecting it is very easy to dredge those feelings of frustration up, which isn't great in general but really useful 
                                for this exercise.
