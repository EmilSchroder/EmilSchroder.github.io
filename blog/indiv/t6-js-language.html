                            <h3>Bracket Notation</h3>
                            <p>
                                
                                <h4>Round Brackets <code>()</code></h4>
                                There are a few serperate areas where round brakcets crop up.
                                They can be used for loops to hold true/false statements i.e. 
                                <code>if(n<5)</code>. In other loops they can have initial conditions and 
                                iteration steps as well i.e. <code>for (var n=0, n<5, n++)</code>.
                                In functions they contain the input parameters that the function requires to run like 
                                <code>function carrots (water, soil, seeds){};</code>. Finally the can be used in the pure 
                                mathematical way to show which operation is prioritised; the following would sum <code>b</code> and
                                <code>c</code> together before subtracting the total from <code>a</code>:<br>
                                <code>x = a - (b + c);</code>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <h4>Square Brackets<code>[]</code></h4>
                                Square brackets are often seen setting up arrays and accessing elements in those arrays like numbers or objects. Arrays are 
                                a structured data format so every element has a fixed position where the first element is denoted as 
                                <code>Array[0]</code> and the sequential elements are counted up from there so that <code>nth element = Array[n-1]</code>.<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <h4>Curly Brackets<code>{}</code></h4>
                                Curly brackets are used to contain processes that need to be run or to set up objects. For containg 
                                processes take a <code>for</code> loop. Everything that needs to be run according to the loops instructions happens within
                                the defined curly brackets.<br>
                                For example <code>for (var i=0, i<10, i++){count++}</code> increases the <code>count</code> by one while the loop conditions remain true.<br>
                                For setting up objects a new variable is declared with the properties of the object (once the curly brackets get involved the variable becomes
                                an object) listed within the curly brackets. This <code>tree</code> is an example object:<br>
                                <code>var tree = {branches: 100, leaves: 1000, trunk: 1};</code>
