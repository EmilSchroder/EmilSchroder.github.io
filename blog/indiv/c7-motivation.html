                            <p>
                                Reflecting on what I go after most I realise I have been more pleasure focussed, not finding
                                much passion or purpose in my work and just using my spare time to recharge. Recently I've been
                                able to concentrate on coding and creating which definately has enagaged my passion side.<br>
                                My core values centre around enjoying life and having fun in whatever I do, and I feel like I 
                                have failed when I am not enjoying my surroundings. I liked the exercise around allowing yourself 
                                to feel both success and defeat and breaking them down into their physiological components. It 
                                let me recognise that dread and elation have similar symptoms, but dread has more closed off body 
                                language like hunched shoulders.
