            <h2>Search Inside Yourself - Chapter 4 - Body Scanning</h2>
            <p>
                Self awareness seems to be a subset of mindfulness. Mindfulness maintains attention on an action or view
                without the mind imposing itself on that action or view. Self awareness is the special case of the view
                being that of your own body.<br>
                I tried the body scanning and agreed with the author that it was very closely related to feeling sleepy. 
                I have not been in a particularly emotionally turbulent state recently so its effects didn't feel very pronounced.<br>
                In the "Emotions are not me" section the author notes you can consider your emotional state as seperate from
                your being and that the link between the two can be regulated. Controlling your emotions is certainly a 
                large part of a reasoned emotional response to a stressful situation. His points around the dichotomy of
                the ego were also interesting.
