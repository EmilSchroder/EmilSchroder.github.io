                                The empathetic listening is a bit odd because the people I talk with expect more input (more interesting input explicitly)
                                than what the empathetic listening prescribes; it unnerves people a bit. I have begun approaching interpersonal 
                                situations with more openness and positivity and it seems to make people more well disposed.<br>
                                For the political awareness exercise there was a time at work where someone wasn't following a process and it 
                                was causing a headache for everyone but them. I explained to them that these processes were in place to 
                                promote transparency and ultimately make it easier for everyone involved as long as people took the time to understand 
                                it. From his perspective he will have seen it as red tape that was stopping the outcome that he wanted.
