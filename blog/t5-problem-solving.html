                            <h2>Getting Blocked</h2>
                            <p>
                                In sprint 4 I was horribly blocked by one of the practice JS questions. There was
                                something about it where I couldn't work out how the syntax was supposed to be ordered. I started
                                with trial and error but then moved on to psuedocode but no luck.<br>
                                There was fortunatley a lot of resources online and I was able to find a similar question that 
                                incorporated the same syntax which I was able to mimic and make fit.<br>
                                Solving it was a huge relief, though I am glad for the struggle because it is the dread of going
                                through that drawn-out thought process again that really cements the knowledge in your mind.
                                I didn't learn that much in a meta sense (of course I learnt the necessary syntax to resolve the issue)
                                but it is good to reaffirm that sticking to it will get you the results you want.
