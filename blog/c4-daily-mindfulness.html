        <h2>Mindfulness Conversation</h2>
        <p>
            The conversation seemed fairly ordinary.
            I grew up with a lot of audio books (and now podcasts)
            so paying attention while listening has been 
            something that is natural. The other person thought
            it was weird; that is expected when you ask someone
            to speak on the spot for 3 minutes.<br>
            Listening is the easiest for practicing so I will
            go with that to sustain my practice. People at
            work like to talk so there will be ample opportunity.
