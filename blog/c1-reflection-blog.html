                Mindset is the biggest upfront message that EDA has focussed on. It is 
                an approach that is tightly aligned to the theories around gameplay style 
                learning where exploration and failure are built in as features to the 
                experience, something that can't be avoided so shouldn't be avoided.

                Ultimately you don't always know if you are going to gel with a particular
                culture or not until you're in it. I like working with people; they brighten
                up the day and feedback on ideas. This kind of problem solving work is
                also a huge amount of fun which helps with powering through the small things like existential
                dread or stuffing up for the hundreth time. My biggest concern is getting
                into the work in a group situation and not having anything interesting to share
                or contribute. This never really turns out to be true for anyone as everyone has some
                unique perspective however rationality and fear are not always entangled so the feeling
                is hard to dismiss.

                Sum-up: this whole adventure will be quite exciting and I look forward to seeing
                my fingers and a keyboard are capable of producing. Ideally something useful.
