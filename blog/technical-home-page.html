                            <h2>Javascript</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Javascript is a language that can create and alter objects
                                    and variables. It differs from HTML in that if doesn't outline 
                                    a structure for webpage or work in a tag based way. It is also
                                    different from CSS as it can be used to alter existing objects
                                    rather than just style them.<br>
                                    Loops work in an intuative way where you set initial conditions, 
                                    constraints and an iteration pattern, and then allow it perform its
                                    action on the object or variable that is within the loop. For example
                                    you can use the idea of spreading butter on toast. You start with no 
                                    butter on your and you keep spreading more on until the toast is covered
                                    in butter.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Arrays and objects are both ways of storing data in Javascript. Arrays have
                                    elements are are stored in an ordered set where the zeroth (initial or first) element
                                    is at the front of the set with the n-1th at the end. To access an element you
                                    can call its position in the line up.<br>
                                    Object have properties that are denoted by a name, but don't have a purposeful order.
                                    There are a couple of ways to call properties from objects; the first is the dot notation
                                    for a string or conversion of a string i.e. myCouch.redCushion. The second is bracket
                                    notation and can be used when the property is not a string like in this example 
                                    where there is a space between the words <br>i.e. myCouch["Red Cushion"].<br>
                                    Functions are sets of code where you plug in variables and they return an answer or 
                                    set of answers (depending of specifications) based off those variables (typically).
                                    They are useful as black boxes where you can throw variables at them and get meaningful
                                    answers in return.
                                </p>
                            <h2>Frameworks</h2>
                            <p>
                                Frameworks give a pre-configured base and rules set to allow you to start building websites quickly and simply. The developer benefits from
                                not having to spend time building the same functionality from scratch. The downsides are a standarised model which can leave the design
                                feeling a bit bland.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Responsive Websites</h2>
                            <p>
                                Website designers must have an idea about how people are viewing their content which means the behavior and habits of the consumers
                                must be acknowledged when a website is being created. If your target audience is split between browsing on their phones, tablets and computers
                                then you need a way of making sure all three are accomodated. Responsive websites are designed to allow the aesthetics and functionality of a website
                                to remain intact no matter the size of the viewing screen.<br>

                                and with the lesser processing power of a phone compared to a computer their is a rise in "mobile-first" design. This assumes the mobile device
                                is the default viewer and has the developer put its design considerations first.

                            <p>
                                Wireframes are quick sketches of the intended layout of your webpage. For simplicity it can just be a monochromatic drawing of where you intend 
                                to put certain boxes that will hold content. I found that many of the features I had drawn up in the wireframes surpassed my technical knowledge
                                so comprimised quite heavily to produce what I have.

                            <p>
                                In short in a webpage HTML sets the structure, makes it pretty, and the DOM acts as an interface with HTML 
                                so that other programmes can act upon it.<br>
                                This set of friends can be thought of like an external hardrive. The HTML is the circuit board, CSS is the
                                box that houses it, and the DOM is the USB dongle that lets it connect into things like the TV or computer.

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Boxifying is what it sounds like, turning an open space (in this case the webpage) into a set of rectangles 
                                with their own unqiue place and, ideally, purpose. Breaking it down into these boxes allows easier design of the page
                                as the boxes are self container and only the size, margins and padding of a box impacts other boxes, not what is in it.
                            </p>

                            <h2>
                                Grid based design
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Grids are key to organisation on the webpage. They allow designers to easily create patterns and symmetry in a way
                                that is pleasing to the user and simple to represent on a webpage.<br>
                                Grids also provide a conceptual way to scale up and down page view. Responsive webpage layouts are booming as the habits of
                                consumers move more towards consuming digital media on mobile devices, rather than traditional computers. Needing to represent
                                webpages in both these fashions means needing to adopt a shared design language and practice. Grids, with their ability to scale 
                                up and down at will, are a good fit for this.
                            </p>

                                Semantic structure
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Semantic tags in HTML are the tags that give the reader and the browser deeper knowledge about the actual purpose of the content being 
                                displayed and the structure is how this is all organised in terms of parent/child relationships. Semantic tags have come about so that 
                                browers are able to represent information in a more meaningful way. When using generic tags like div, there is no context around what 
                                the content may be or relate to. To add context a semantic tag can be used; for example h1 indicates that what is written is a header 
                                for the whole page, or time denotes a date/time. This information is of particular value to search engines that want to represent 
                                meaningful information to their users.
