                                HTML, CSS and DOM
                            </h2> 
                            <p>
                                In short in a webpage HTML sets the structure, makes it pretty, and the DOM acts as an interface with HTML 
                                so that other programmes can act upon it.<br>
                                This set of friends can be thought of like an external hardrive. The HTML is the circuit board, CSS is the
                                box that houses it, and the DOM is the USB dongle that lets it connect into things like the TV or computer.
                            </p>
                            <h2>
                                Boxifying Design
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Boxifying is what it sounds like, turning an open space (in this case the webpage) into a set of rectangles 
                                with their own unqiue place and, ideally, purpose. Breaking it down into these boxes allows easier design of the page
                                as the boxes are self container and only the size, margins and padding of a box impacts other boxes, not what is in it.
                            </p>

                            <h2>
                                Grid based design
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Grids are key to organisation on the webpage. They allow designers to easily create patterns and symmetry in a way
                                that is pleasing to the user and simple to represent on a webpage.<br>
                                Grids also provide a conceptual way to scale up and down page view. Responsive webpage layouts are booming as the habits of
                                consumers move more towards consuming digital media on mobile devices, rather than traditional computers. Needing to represent
                                webpages in both these fashions means needing to adopt a shared design language and practice. Grids, with their ability to scale 
                                up and down at will, are a good fit for this.
                            </p>

                                Semantic structure
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Semantic tags in HTML are the tags that give the reader and the browser deeper knowledge about the actual purpose of the content being 
                                displayed and the structure is how this is all organised in terms of parent/child relationships. Semantic tags have come about so that 
                                browers are able to represent information in a more meaningful way. When using generic tags like div, there is no context around what 
                                the content may be or relate to. To add context a semantic tag can be used; for example h1 indicates that what is written is a header 
                                for the whole page, or time denotes a date/time. This information is of particular value to search engines that want to represent 
                                meaningful information to their users.
